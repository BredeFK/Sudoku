#Project 1

- Brede Fritjof Klausen
- Programmering [Applikasjon]

## OBS!
An ``IllegalArgumentException`` occurs when the user is typing twice in the same box! <br>
This could be fixed with ``Platform.runLater``, but that only made more bugs, so I left it. <br>
It says it's from an ``Unknown source``, but I think it occurs on line 229  in ``SudukoViewController.java``
